I HATE PYTHON SOO MUCH
IT'S 4TH OF AUGUST 2K24, NOT SO LONG FROM THE DAY I DECIDED TO LEARN PYTHON'S SYNTAX CAUSE IT WAS THERE IN OUT SYLLABUS. 
I USED TO MAKE FUN OF PYTHON BY CALLING IT 'ASSEMBLY' NOT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE BUT IT'S USER FRIENDLY AND EVERYONE LOVES THAT 
EASY TO LEARN SYNTAX ADN EVERYTHING ABOUT PYTHON. 

I AGREE THAT IT HAS SOO MANY LIBRARIES AND IT'S COOL BUT CAN PYTHON AND EVERYONE WHO LIKES THAT LAME AHH LANGUAGE FUCK OFF ?! 

I AM WRITING THIS CAUSE I AM GIVING UP ON IT :3 
I WILL ONLY LEARN PYTHON FOR MY ACADEMICS ONLY WITH NO PERSONAL INTEREST CAUSE :3 

GIVING UP ON PYTHON, THIS WILL BE A FAREWELL.
